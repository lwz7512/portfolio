It's been a long time not writing something formal, especially when I went through the failure of my first startup. After years of re-adjusting in job and family, now I moved to a new city with family members and started a new life. In order to keep me make daily progress in technical and english, I setup this hexo blog, and decide to record something useful everyday.


I believe that I have much to learn in my field(Front-end/Mobile App Dev), even working on these stuff for more than 10 years, there still remains much new untouched. By reviewing the works/projects of past couples of years, I found that It's too miserable, no success, no proud, no value...


This year, 2018, keep learning , writing, participating community, doing something valuable stuff, even tiny. Forget those nonsense and bullshit politics, focus on my mission, go, now!
