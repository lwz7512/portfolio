![Halifax approaching summer](/img/halifax_summer.jpg)

Time passed so quickly, 6 months no any blog post. One reason is I'm busy in developing UltroEle, and manage to pass driver test(stucked in road test), meanwhile waiting for the immigration process. The other reason is ... I'm too lazy and have no good status to write something.

Now, finally, I have time to summarize all of my achievments in this period:

* Driver license got in 15th Feb.
* Immigration process completed and confirmed in 21th Apr.
* House purchase offer confirmed and Loan approved in 9th May
* Halifax Gatsby meetup founded in 27th May
* Elearning product UltronEle v1.0 officially released in 20th June
* Registration for son's new school in 25th June

But, still the difficulties to melt into this new environment are there ahead... So, I registered the english courses and sessions for Nova Scotia introduction, our family members all need to learning english continously. 

At the same time, I need to expose myself to social media like Twitter, blog platform such as Medium, dev.to, and Gatsby blog...to promote myself, my works through technical post writing.

That's why I stop writing here, I need a bigger stage to demonstrate myself, to setup connection with people all over the world, they may bring potential opportunities to me, after all, I have been out of The Great Wall already. 

Quoting the famous saying from Jobs to close this post:
