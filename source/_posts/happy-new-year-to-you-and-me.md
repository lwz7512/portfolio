It's been a month rightly since I arrived halifax in 30 Nov. In this month I have two small outcomes or fruits although I haven't pass the road test for driver license yet.

* Gatsbyjs starter: [gatsby-netlify-identity-starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/lwz7512/gatsby-netlify-identity-starter/)
* Gitbook 3.2.4: [True Love version](https://github.com/lwz7512/gitbook)


Although it did not attact too much attentions, i do believe it will help someone needed, and peolple will like it. Open source project participation give me great confidence in this new city, and let me have courage to other thing ...I'm sure to continue do more intersting stuff and product, this is my true value.

One big good news to me in this month is that I'm a member of `Gatsby` community officially! I'm very happy to it, this is my first open source community role since my IT career...

Tomorrow will be the first day of new year 2019, here I send my sincere greetings to my friends both domestic and Canada: 

> HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU, AND KEEP CONFIDENCE TO FACE NEW CHALLENGES, BECAUSE I AM HERE WITH YOUR!
