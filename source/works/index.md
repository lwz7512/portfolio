> Below is my works in latest years, some of that are side projects but still invested much time to it ...
> I love hybrid mobile application development approaches, using javascript/HTML/Ionic/Cordova, it's very efficient and cost saving.
> For the future products, I'll try react-native solution, because I'd found that it can achieve some targets ideally such as: live video streaming, realtime chat, but impossible for cordova architecture.
